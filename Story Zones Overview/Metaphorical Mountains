- Min just climbed a bunch of hills, so these mountains aren't the most...
enticing things at the moment

- He can navigate left or right past the first mountain, or go over it. If 
he chooses to go over it, there'll be some exhaustive dialogue

- Encounters, left and right, as usual

- Last mountain, he can go up it for a secret or something, or just go around it
much more easily. Will the secret be worth it? No bloody clue

- At the end of the path, he'll be greeted by Platato, who tries to explain
the importance of his choices in crossing these mountains

- Min has none of it, and explains that he'll level these mountains and 
harvest them for minerals once he comes back at some point

- Min vs Platato

- Min can head to the city
